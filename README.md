# Computer Graphics Assignment

Simple A-Frame based WebVR scene for the Computer Graphics assignment.

## Overview
This project contains a minimal A-Frame scene (index.html) intended to demonstrate basic WebVR/WebXR and 3D concepts in the browser.

## Project structure
- index.html — main A-Frame scene (entry point)
- README.md — this file
- (optional) assets/ — textures, models, scripts used by the scene

## Problems encountered
- making the textures seem realistic
-

## Notes
- A-Frame is loaded from the CDN in index.html (https://aframe.io/releases/).
- Use a local server to avoid potential cross-origin issues when loading external assets.
